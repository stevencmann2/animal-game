# animal-game

This repo contains my animal game using JQuery!

In this game, you'll need to select a combination of the four animals displayed to match the exact target score generated. Be careful, if you go over the target score you'll have to start again. Each animal clicked will give you a different score .The values of the animals will change with each game, so you'll need to pay attention. Good luck and have fun with it!
